# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
### CodeAlpha Internship

---

## 📁 Project Overview

This project is part of the **CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship**.  
The focus of this task is on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python to understand data patterns, detect anomalies, and generate meaningful insights.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Ask meaningful questions before analysis.
- Explore the data structure including types, missing values, and distributions.
- Identify **patterns, trends**, and **anomalies**.
- Validate assumptions using visualizations and statistics.
- Detect potential **data quality issues** or areas for deeper investigation.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- vscode

## 📂 Dataset

- **Dataset Name**: *StudentsPerformance.csv*
- **Source**: *chatgpt*
- **Description**: *A popular dataset used for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data visualization, and machine learning practice.

-Contains data for 1,000 students.

-Includes scores from math, reading, and writing exams.

-Captures demographic and social factors related to each student.

-Helps analyze the impact of gender, ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation on student performance.

-Useful for uncovering patterns, trends, and correlations in student academic outcomes.

-Frequently used in beginner data science and analytics projects.*

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- 📌 Insight 1: *📌 Students who completed the test preparation course scored significantly higher in all three subjects (math, reading, and writing).*
- 📌 Insight 2: *Female students performed better in reading and writing, while male students had slightly higher scores in math.*
- 📌 Insight 3: *📌 There is a strong correlation between reading and writing scores—students who do well in one tend to do well in the other*
